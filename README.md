# How to Use `todopkg`

### Installing Python

Please make sure you have Python 3.9 or above on your local machine, you can get the latest Python from its [official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing `todopkg`

To install `todopkg` via pip, run:

```bash
pip install todopkg
```

### Import `todopkg`

After installing `todopkg`, you can import `todopkg` to your program using:

  ```python
  from todopkg import TodoListManager
  ```

## Documentation and Instruction

- **Create a to-do list instance:**

  When you instantiate the manager, you have the option to specify the filename for saving and loading your to-do lists, as well as control the auto-restore feature that automatically loads existing to-do lists at startup.

  `filename`: This optional parameter allows you to specify the name and path of the file where your to-do lists will be saved (it needs to be a json file). By default, it is set to 'todolist.json'.

  `enable_auto_restore`: Also optional, this flag lets you decide whether to automatically load the to-do lists from the specified file when the manager is created. It is enabled by default.

  - **Default:**

    ```python
    todo_manager = TodoListManager()
    ```

  - **Use custom storage file:**

    ```python
    todo_manager = TodoListManager(filename = my_file.json)
    ```
  - **Disable auto restore:**

    ```python
    todo_manager = TodoListManager(enable_auto_restore = False)
    ```
  - **Use custom storage file and Disable auto restore:**

    ```python
    todo_manager = TodoListManager(filename = my_file.json, enable_auto_restore = False)
    ```

- **Create a new to-do list:**

  Different to-do lists need to have distinct names.

  **Create a to-do list named 'Groceries':**
  ```python
  todo_manager.create_todo_list('Groceries')
  ```
  **Create another to-do list named 'Homeworks':**
  ```python
  todo_manager.create_todo_list('Homeworks')
  ```
- **Add items to the to-do list:**

  To add an item to your to-do list, you'll use the `add_item_to_todo_list` function. You need to specify the name of the list and the item you wish to add.  Items may be assigned a priority level (`int`) or a due date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), or both, and will be displayed in sorted order accordingly. When both are specified, priority ranking takes precedence over the due date.
  - **Without priority or due date:**

    ```python
    todo_manager.add_item_to_todo_list('Groceries', 'Apples')
    ```
  - **With priority only (the lower the number, the higher the priority):**

    ```python
    todo_manager.add_item_to_todo_list('Homeworks', 'Midterm Review', priority=1)
    ```
  - **With due date only (due date in format "YYYY-MM-DD"):**

    ```python
    todo_manager.add_item_to_todo_list('Homeworks', 'Essay', due_date="2023-11-10")
    ```
  - **With both priority and due date:**

    ```python
    todo_manager.add_item_to_todo_list('Homeworks', 'Essay', priority=2, due_date="2023-11-10")
    ```
- **Remove items from the to-do list:**
  
  To remove an item, you need to specify the list name and the index of the item using `remove_item_from_todo_list` function. Indexing starts at 0, so to remove the first item, you would use index 0.
  ```python
  todo_manager.remove_item_from_todo_list('Groceries', 0)
  ```

- **Update to-do list name:**

  If you need to rename a to-do list, provide the current name followed by the new name to the `change_todo_list_name` function.

  ```python
  todo_manager.change_todo_list_name('Groceries', 'Supermarket')
  ```

- **Delete to-do list:**

  To completely remove a to-do list, simply provide the name of the list to the `delete_todo_list` function.
  ```python
  todo_manager.delete_todo_list('Supermarket')
  ```

- **Show all to-do list:**

  The `show_all_todo_list` function returns a dictionary containing all to-do lists with their items. Each key in the dictionary is a list name, and its value is a list of tasks.

  ```python
  todo_manager.show_all_todo_list()
  ```

  You can manipulate this dictionary however you like to integrate with your application. It provides a 'raw' format for advanced usage and flexibility.

- **Print all to-do lists:**

  The `print_all_todo_lists` function provides a nicely formatted table output to the console for one or all of your to-do lists. You can either print all lists or specify a single list to print by name.

  - **print all to-do lists:**

    ```python
    todo_manager.print_all_todo_lists()
    ```
  - **print a specific to-do list:**
    ```python
    todo_manager.print_all_todo_lists(list_name = 'Groceries')
    ```
- **Displaying all items in a to-do list:**

  To view all the items within a specific to-do list in a formatted, readable manner, you can use the `show_all_items_in_todo_list` function, pass the list's name as the parameter.

  ```python
  todo_manager.show_all_items_in_todo_list('Groceries')
  ```
- **Save to-do lists to a JSON file:**

  Save your to-do lists to a JSON file specified at the beginning using the `save_to_file` function. This functions is invoked automatically before program exit.

  ```python
  todo_manager.save_to_file()
  ```
- **Load to-do lists from a JSON file:**

  Restore your to-do lists from a JSON file specified at the beginning using `load_from_file` function. This function is automatically invoked upon instantiation of `TodoListManager` if `enable_auto_restore` is `True`.

  ```python
  todo_manager.load_from_file()
  ```
